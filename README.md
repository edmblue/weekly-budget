I'm so so proud of myself because I managed to do this

It took me more that I what I thought but it taught me so much about some array methods i didn't completely know how to use, learn and understand about scope, everything was greaaaaaaaaaaat, I'm really happy how it turned out

Also I added a little from myself cause in the initial project they took the 'presupuesto' with a prompt method, but I wanted to do it more moderm, so I learned a little of bootstrap in the process

Can't wait of the next one
